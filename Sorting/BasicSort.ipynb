    "# Bubble Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "- is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, and swapping their values if needed.\n",
    "- These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps have to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted. The algorithm is named for the way the larger elements \"bubble\" up to the top of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The bubble sort algorithm works by comparing adjacent elements in a list and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. It continues this process until the entire list is sorted.\n",
    "- This method is not suitable for large data sets due to its average and worst-case time complexity, which is O(n^2).However, it can be optimized by stopping the algorithm if the inner loop didnâ€™t cause any swaps"
