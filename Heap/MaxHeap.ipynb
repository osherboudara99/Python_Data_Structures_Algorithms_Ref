    "## Heap\n",
    "Heap is like a BST.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heap also must be a complete tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete Binary Tree: A Binary Tree is complete Binary Tree if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Max heap: Highest value on top. Root has to be greater than children. \n",
    "\n",
    "Min Heap: Lowest value on top. Root has to be less than all children.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation**\n",
    "- Use a list to store heap value\n",
    "- Root goes in zero index (some people do first index since math is easier for calculating child positions; zero index left as None), and left to right we fill in rest of list\n",
    "- Since it is a complete tree, there should be no gaps in our list\n",
    "\n",
    "- Insertion\n",
    "  - No matter order of numbers, we insert value first in the next open spot in heap (because tree needs to remain complete)\n",
    "  - After insertion, we compare against parent (greater or less than depending on max or min heap) and swap. Swap until it is in the correct position. Called bubble up\n",
    "- Removing\n",
    "  - Whether it is a min or max heap, we always only remove the root node\n",
    "  - Issue: reconstructing heap is difficult, we must always make sure heap is complete\n",
    "  - Solution: Move most right child up to root and sink down to the position it should be in (instead of bubble up)\n",
    "  - Lot of time complexity in the remove method\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Cases**\n",
    "- Heaps are great for priority queues, we also just pop the top off\n",
    "- Can use Linked List but we have to search list for highest value and it may take time.\n",
    "- Can use regular list but still have to search list for value\n",
    "- Can use dictionary cause you can find the key but then we still have to compare against other keys\n",
    "- Can use BST but they aren't always balanced, if you have a weird tree, it may take O(N)\n",
    "- Heap is always better because we remove which is O(1) and if we sink down, we only sink the height of tree which is O(log n) -> same idea with insert, we only bubble up the height (O(log n))\n",
    "- Big O is better for heaps so we use them over LinkedList in a priority queue"
