    "## __hash Method explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Hash tables can be a bit tricky, so let's break down your question about the __hash method and the use of a prime number like 23.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a hash table, we need a way to convert keys into array indices. This is done by a hash function. A good hash function distributes keys uniformly across the array, minimizing the chances of two keys hashing to the same index, a situation known as a collision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, why do we often use prime numbers in these hash functions, like 23 in your example?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reducing Collisions: Prime numbers help in spreading keys more uniformly across the array. By using a prime number, the hash function tends to produce a unique value for each unique key, which reduces collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uniform Distribution: When we multiply by a prime number, the hash values are less likely to form patterns. Non-prime numbers, especially those that are factors of the array size, tend to cause more clustering in the hash table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maximizing Efficiency: The goal is to use the entire array as effectively as possible. Prime numbers help in achieving this by ensuring that each key is more likely to be hashed to a different index.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, using a prime number like 23 in a hash function helps to distribute the keys more uniformly across the hash table, reducing the likelihood of collisions and making the hash table more efficient. This choice is a balance between complexity and effectiveness, making prime numbers a popular choice in hash function design.\n",
